## Develop a data explorative tool 

This project combines Max tree data structure (implemented by [DISCCOFAN](https://github.com/sgazagnes/disccofan) ) and Self Organising Maps (implemented by [minisom](https://github.com/JustGlowing/minisom/tree/master), ) to develop self-organising attribute maps and pattern spectra.
The code explores image morphological structures automatically.
